## What is Version Control? {#py-version-control-intro}

FIXME: Figure - PhD Comics, A Story Told in File Names <http://phdcomics.com/comics.php?f=1323>

When working with files on a computer - documents, scripts, anything involving
text - it's common to run into the situation above.
There may be information you don't want
in the final version, but you want to be able to refer back to previous versions
of the file. You may want to
work on a document and then start over if it's not going well.
It is useful to have a record of changes you've
made and the previous versions of your work just for your own psychological reassurance.

Specifically applied to our world of data science projects, here are some
examples of when we might want to maintain multiple versions of one file:

- adding a new dataset to our analysis
- constantly modifying or updating the same script
- incorporating comments or feedback from a reader
- keeping backup copies of important files

The multi-file system above is not ideal though!
It requires making multiple copies of the
same file, even if the changes are isolated to one part of the file. It also
isn't always easy to know which file has the information that you want
to retrieve.

Luckily, there's a better solution - using a version control system. A version
control system is a specific tool that can be used to track changes
in a file or set of files. The version control tool keeps a record
of changes made to a file, while still only having one copy of the file on
your hard drive. This record of changes consists of snapshots called
"revisions" or "commits". Most of the day-to-day use of version control
systems consists of periodically creating these revisions/commits to record
the current state of a file
or folder, and how it's changed since the previous revision.
Whenever you create a saved revision through
a version control system, you have a chance to add a message that provides some
information about the file(s) to that point, making it easier to find previous
versions of a file.

This chapter will focus on a specific version control tool called "git". Git
is a program that can be installed on your computer and we'll use it to perform
all of the functions described above—creating saved revisions with messages,
referencing previous versions of files, and duplicating this revision history
across multiple computers.

There are other version control programs that can be used for the same purposes; CVS, SVN, and Mercurial are three examples. We've used git in this
chapter because it's commonly used and is compatible with at least two free,
online spaces for hosting version controlled work.

We'll be using a program called GitKraken to make it easier to use git, in the
same way that we used the Spyder IDE to help us write Python code.

## Creating a Repository {#py-version-control-repo}

To get started with tracking work, it's good to think about what scope of
information you want to track. Does it make sense to track all of the files of your
computer at once? Probably not. It would be better for the version control system to
track changes on a per-project basis. In terms of how we have files
organized on our computer, that means we want to track changes inside a project
folder (and all its sub-folders).

The mechanism used by git to track work is called a "repository" (or "repo" for
short) and so for each project where we want to track changes, we need to create a
version control repository (in our case, a git repository) associated
with the parent folder of the project.

In the GitKraken interface, there's a button to do exactly that, over on the
left: "Start a local repo". It's possible to use this button to associate a
repository with a pre-existing folder, but it's simpler to generate a repository
with a new folder in one go, so that's what we'll do.

1. Click on the "Start a local repo" button.
2. This should open up a three part window, where the left part has
"Init" selected, the middle part has "Local Only" and the right has some options
to fill in.
3. Fill in a name for your repository in the "Name:" box. It can be anything you want.
4. If you want, choose where to create this repository/folder by selecting a
location on your computer in "Initialize in:"
5. Finally, click on "Create Repository"

```{r py-version-control-getting-started, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Getting Started"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/FIXME.png")
```

Once this process succeeds, a few things should happen. You should see a folder
called `test` on your computer's desktop and the GitKraken window will suddenly
have a lot more panes. Just like with Spyder, we're going to focus on just
a part of the window for now - the right hand pane, and the middle section.

```{r py-version-control-important-panes, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Important Panes"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/FIXME.png")
```

At this point, we've created a git repository associated with our project
folder. Now if we make any changes in that folder (or a sub-folder!), git
will pay attention and be able to track it for us. Let's see what happens
if we do this.

## Tracking Changes {#py-version-control-tracking-changes}

As we add and modify files in our project folder, we want to record our changes.
This is done by creating "commits" which are like snapshots of the repository at
moments in time. By building up a history of many commits, each created for a
different phase of the files in the repository, you can see what changes have happened over time.

The process of tracking changes in this way has three stages:

1. Create new files or make changes to existing files in the project repository.
2. Choose the files that you want to create a saved version of (called "staging" or "adding")
3. "Commit" the changes from the previous step, with a descriptive commit message.

![commit-cycle](figures/FIXME.png)


To see this in action, create a file called `README.md` in your test repository.
You can technically do this through GitKraken, but it would make more sense to
create this file in a text editor like Spyder - it should just be a plain text
document, saved in the main folder.

## My notes

```

After creating this file, switch back to GitKraken and
look at the right side of the GitKraken interface. You should see a few changes
in the right hand pane. If you click on "View Change", the right pane will change to show you the list of files that git knows has changed. In this case, it should
have the new `README.md` cycle.

It's now time to do the second part of the cycle—*adding* or *staging* files to commit. In the GitKraken interface, this can be done by hitting the "stage all changes" button (which will add *all* the changed files to the list to be committed) or you can click on individual files and then click on the "Stage File" button.

Once you've done this, the files that are to be added to the commit will be now in the second box of the right pane, the staging area. If you made a mistake and added files you aren't yet ready to snapshot, you can "unstage" them here. Once you have the list of files you want to stage, write a commit message in the third box. Then click on the commit changes to one file.

We're sent back to our history mode, with the right pane showing us the latest commit. We've gone through the change-and-commit cycle one time. Git has saved
information about the state of our `README.md` file in the repository we created
in the previous section. Now, if we make additional changes to the `README.md`
file, we'll be able to create new commits, building up a history of changes.

Try making changes to `README.md` under the "My Notes" section
and committing them. Create a separate Python script and
commit that as well, to see what it looks like to have multiple files in
the repository. The best way to get used to the process of using version
control to track changes is to run through it a few times.

Some questions to think about as you practice making commits:

- How often should you create new commits after making changes?
    - It's best to create commits fairly frequently, so that you have a good snapshot of your progress. If changes need to take effect at the same time on a group of files, you should commit them together; if changes are unrelated, it's a good idea to separate them into their own commits.
- What makes a good version control commit message?
    - A good commit message is succinct but meaningful. While many
developers can easily slip into commit messages like "@)#(*&#@)(*!", it's
worth the extra few seconds to type something meangingful, especially for our
next task: examining previous versions of files.

## Examining Previous Versions {#py-version-control-examining-versions}

We want to keep track of previous versions of a file because sometimes, it's
important to go back and either access the previous version in total, or just
see the differences between where we started and where we are now. We've used
Git to create a list of commits that record versions of a file; now we want to
use that history to look back at previous versions of files and compare them
with our current version.

Another way to think about this is that instead of just going
around the change-and-commit cycle in one direction, we want to be able to reverse direction and look at the past.

![revert-image](figures/FIXME.png)

In order to compare versions of files, we first need to find the versions we
want to compare, from somewhere in our repository's log or history. This is
why our commit messages were important! Once you find the commit (or commits)
that have the versions you want to reference, it's relatively simple to compare them
or revert a file back to its previous version.

If you haven't already, make a few more changes to the "My notes" section of the
 `README.md` file
and commit them, and do this enough times to have 3-4 commits in your central
history window.

The history of commits is in the center pane of the GitKraken
window. Choose one of the commits you want to examine, and click on it.
You'll see the right hand pane show
all the information associated with the commit, including the file(s)
modified in that commit. (If you want to see *all* the files as they were during a particular commit
(not just the modified files), select the desired commit and then click the
"View all files" checkbox in the middle-right of the right-hand pane.)
Click on a file to see the version saved in the commit.

The file will open in the center pane (replacing the history) and at the
top will be a toggle between "File View" and "Diff View". "File View" shows the
file as it was when the commit was made. If you click on
the "Diff View" side, the file will show how it changed since the previous
version of the file. Additions are indicated with green highlighting and a plus; deletions
with red highlighting and a minus.

You can compare in more selective ways by selecting a whole series of commits,
from the commit history, clicking on a changed file, and looking at how the
file has changed from the most recent commit you selected to the one preceeding
the oldest commit you selected.

Finally, sometimes you may want to return back to a previous version altogether.
To do this, select the commit you want to return to from the commit history.
Right click on it and then select "Revert commit". GitKraken will ask you if
you want to commit changes immediately. Clicking "yes" will change the file back
to a previous version and simultaneously commit it; clicking "no" will simply
change the file back, but if you want to keep it, you have to go through the
add and commit process yourself.

## Online Repositories {#py-version-control-remote}

To this point, we've used git features to track changes and compare versions
of files in our project repository. An additional way to use git to manage our
project is to create a duplicate of our project repository online. As we commit
changes to the project on our computer, we can periodically update the online
copy so that we have a backup. Sending changes from our computer to an online
copy is called "pushing" and if we want to get changes from the online copy to
our computer, the command is called "pulling." In what follows, we'll set up
a blank online repository and push and pull changes to and from it.

![remote-image](figures/FIXME.png)

We'll be using Github as the home for the online copy of the project repository.
To start, create an empty repository on Github by going to the main Github
page and clicking on the green "New" button on the left. You must be logged in
for this to work!

You'll be taken to a screen that gives you some options about
your new repository - because we want it to be blank, leave all the options as
they are. The only piece you need to fill in is a name for the repository. This
doesn't have to be the same as the folder on your computer, but for clarity, it
should be clear that they're related.

After you click on the "Create repository" button, you'll be taken to a page
with your new blank repository. The link in your browser should be of the format
```
https://github.com/username/repositoryname
```
Copy this link - we'll need it in a moment.

The next step is to link the project repository on our computer with the (blank) online one.
To do this, venture into the left pane of the GitKraken Window, where it says
"REMOTE". Click on the plus that appears there and a window will open for
adding a remote (online) repository. You can give it a nickname in the
"Name" box and then paste in the link to your repository for both the Pull URL
and Push URL. Click "Add Remote."

The nickname for your online repository should now appear on the left. We
want to update it with our local copy—aka, a "push." Click on the push
button on the top of the GitKraken screen and use the default options. If you
refresh the Github page with your repository, it should now be updated with the
information you've committed on your computer.

If you're always making changes on your own computer, you can keep using
the commit cycle from before, and periodically push those changes to the remote
(online) copy of the repository.

However, it's also possible (and common) that changes are made to the online
copy that you'll want to update on your own computer. To test this out, first
make a change to the `README.md` file in your Github repository. You can do this
by clicking on the file, clicking on the pencil icon on the top-right of the
file, making a change, and then clicking the "Commit changes" button at the
bottom of the page (Figure \@ref(fig:py-version-control-commit)).

```{r py-version-control-commit, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Committing"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/FIXME.png")
```

There are now changes in the online copy that are not in your local
copy. To sync them back up, go back to GitKraken on your computer and
click the "pull" button. The history of commits in the center pane should update
to include the change you just made online.

Note that we started with a repository on a computer and duplicated it online,
but it can go the other way as well. Close the currently open repository in
GitKraken. You should be back at a screen with several options, including "Clone
a repo". If you click on this button, you can paste in the link of a repository
to download from the internet and where to put it on your computer. If you try
this with the link to your own Github repository (but change the location on your
computer), Git will download the same repository in a different place; if you
open it, you'll see that it looks exactly the same as the repository you just
closed.

The moral of the story is that you can create as many copies of a project
repository as you want, but it's a good idea to choose one of to be "official"
version that always has the most-up-to-date copy of your changes. Frequently,
this is the online copy, as it's the easiest to access. Anytime you start
working on a local copy of the repository, it's a good idea to "pull" from the
online copy to make sure you're up-to-date, and then "push" at the end, to make
sure your changes are available online.

## Conflicts {#py-version-control-conflicts}

Even the most careful person will end up making changes in two different copies
of the same repository and then trying to sync them together. Sometimes git is
able to resolve the differences on its own, but sometimes the two changes conflict
and can't be automatically reconciled.

We can create a conflict like this by making changes in our `README.md` file.
First, make sure that your local repository and Github repository are synced
up - that you have pushed all your local changes to Github and pulled all your
Github changes to your local computer.

Then, **on your computer**, make these changes to the `README.md` file:

```
## Meeting time

- December 21, 2019
- 18:00 UTC
```

Commit the changes as we've done before but do **not** push them to Github.

Now, go to your repository on Github, click on the `README.md` file and edit
it as follows:

```
## Meeting time

- November 4, 2018
- 18:00 UTC
```

Commit the changes.

Now we have conflicting changes in our repository—one in the Github copy
and one on our local computer copy.

We want to sync our changes by either pushing from the copy on our computer to
the Github copy or by pulling from the Github copy to our computer. It turns
out that we can't do the first option (try it and see what happens), so we'll
have to use the second option, of pulling from Github to our computer. When
we try this, we should get a few red boxes that pop up saying "Pull failed"
and/or "Merge failed".

> Note that, when we try to push, we *do* have the option of using a "force
push" to override whatever changes we made in Github. If you're absolutely
sure that there's nothing in the Github copy you want, you can try this, but
it's generally a good idea to pull down the changes and look at the conflict,
just to make sure.

Because of the conflicting changes we made, the update of our
local repository failed. Git doesn't know
which changes we really want and has pushed us into a temporary "conflict"
state until we tell it specificallly which changes we want.

To do this, click on "View conflict" (should be on the top right of the
GitKraken window). Click on the file in conflict (`README.md`). This will
open up a different view, where the two conflicting versions of the file
are shown side by side. You can check the box picking one version, the other,
or both, with the combined output shown in the window below. Once you've
picked what you're happy with, click the "Save" button on the top right, close
the file by clicking the "X" and finish the update by clicking on
"Commit and merge" (Figure \@ref(fig:py-version-control-committing)).

```{r py-version-control-committing, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="The Commit Process"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/FIXME.png")
```

## Using Local vs Remote Repositories {#py-version-control-local-vs-remote}

In the previous section, we set up an online copy of our project repository.
This wasn't too risky because our repository didn't have any large file or
confidential information. However, for some projects, that will be the case,
which is why it's important to think carefully before creating an online
repository.

Consider the following before you put it in an online repository:

- Size
    - Github has file size limits; you won't be *allowed* to upload files of
    a certain size. Projects with large data files often store their data in
    other places and then include directions of how to access it in the main
    project repository.
- Privacy
        - If your data includes identifying information or other confidential
    features, it should be placed in a location with the appropriate security.

## To Git-finity, and Beyond {#py-version-control-beyond}

Git was originally developed to manage a BIG and complex software project (development of the Linux operating system kernel) so as a version control system, it's also BIG and complex, with a lot of features that aren't needed for most everyday workflows, especially if you're mostly working by yourself. This chapter has covered what is most essential, and hopefully, most useful. If you find yourself working on more complex projects, especially with multiple collaborators, you may want to learn more about some of git's development and collaboration features. See (book 2?) for more information.

## Exercises

1. Abbie has started working on a data analysis project. She has a copy of the main data set, and sent her supervisor a preliminary report based on a script she has been writing. The response to her report was a lot of comments, and an updated version of the dataset. Meanwhile, she had a colleague look at her script and he refactored it into a more conventional coding standard.
Where are some areas where Abbie could use version control to track her work?

1. Make a change to `README.md` and commit the changes to the repository. How can you check that the changes were committed?

1. FIXME: Screenshot of version history with this series of commits:
"Initial commit", "Adding script", "Removing written in filename", "Using new package functions", "Adding multi-file capabilities."

How would you look at the difference between the current script and when it
had the input filename written into the script?

1. Manuel has a copy of his main repository on his laptop, work computer, and Github. If he has done work on his laptop while traveling, what steps does he need to go through to update the copy on his work computer?  What should he have done before starting to work on his laptop to make this go as smoothly as possible?
