As stated in the intro, our overall goal is to work with people, programs
and data. In this section, we will focus on programs and data as we learn
how to run Python code and
how data is stored and accessed on a computer.

## Introduction to Spyder {#py-getting-started-spyder}

Starting with programs - over the entirety of this book, we'll be writing
programs (or, in verb form, *programming*) in order to accomplish our goals
of working with data on the computer.
Programming is one way to make a computer do something for us.
Instead of clicking, we'll mostly be typing; instead of doing
what someone else has pre-defined, we'll have a lot of flexibility to
do what we want.

Just like using a web browser to access websites, and a program like
Word to write documents, it's helpful to have a program on your computer
that is designed to make it easy to write and run code. This kind of program
is called an "IDE" or Integrated Development Environment.

The one we'll be using in this book for writing Python code is called Spyder.
Spyder (like many IDEs) opens up and has many panes, that each have a different
purpose (Figure \@ref(py-getting-started-spyder).

```{r py-getting-started-spyder, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Spyder"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/FIXME.png")
```

We'll take it slowly and introduce the purpose of each pane one-by-one.
To start with, we'll focus on the left and lower-right panes, as that's
where the bulk of our coding will happen.

## Running Code in the Console {#py-getting-started-console}

Now that we have our code-writing-and-running environment open, it's time to
actually run some code.

In the bottom right pane, you can see something called the "console". This
is a program that is constantly ready and waiting to take in code and run it; as
a Python console, the language it expects to see is Python. Here's
an example you can type or copy in:

```{python}
print("It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.")
```

As you might guess from the name, the Python `print()` function
takes in text (indicated by the quotes) and then prints the text back out to the console.
Python has many built-in functions, that allow you to do different things:

```{python}
len("Sydney Carton")
sorted(["Samuel", "Nathaniel", "Augustus", "Tracy"])
min([4, 2/3, -3, 6.25])
pow(5,3)
```

Part of learning to program is learning some of the core Python functions and
what they do; in upcoming chapters, we'll focus on functions that allow you to
read in and manipulate data. At some point it may be helpful to write your
*own* functions, which we'll also cover in another chapter.

## Running Code via Scripts {#py-getting-started-script}

Can you imagine a situation where continuing to type code into the console
could become tedious or challenging?

Here are some examples:

* Wanting to run the same piece of code many times (you
*can* use the up-arrow to see previous commands - try it! - but if you
run many commands, your history will quickly become more cluttered.
* Wanting to organize long sections of code in a meaningful way and work on
  subsections separately.
- Wanting to save the code as a text file that can be stored on the computer's
  hard drive and shared with collaborators.

So we're motivated to find a way to write and run code where we're keeping
a record as we go along, and it is easy to run code again, in chunks.

The answer to these challenges is to move to the left pane of the Spyder
IDE. This is a script: a text file with Python code. Try copying in some
of the commands we've already run (Figure \@ref(fig:py-getting-started-short-script)):

```{python}
print("It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.")
sorted(["Samuel", "Nathaniel", "Augustus", "Tracy"])
```

```{r py-getting-started-short-script, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="A Short Script"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/FIXME.png")
```

Now these commands are written in the script, but nothing has happened yet.
In order to run the commands from the script (just like we did in the console),
we'll have to use various run commands. You can see these under the "Run" menu;
but typically you'll want to learn at least one or two keyboard shortcuts so
it becomes quick and easy to run code that's written in a script. Try "running"
the lines in your script. You should see their output in the console on the
bottom right.

### Organizing Sections with Code Cells

When writing code it is helpful to have granular control over what code is
executed when and we often don't want to run the entire script. A helpful
feature of scripts are code cells, which are separated by `#%%`. If we would
rewrite the code above so that each line is in a different code cell, it would
look like this.

```{python}
#%%
print("It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.")

#%%
sorted(["Samuel", "Nathaniel", "Augustus", "Tracy"])
```

To run a code cell, we can press `Ctrl+Enter`. To run a code cell and advance
to the next, we can press `Shift+Enter`. Code cells facilitate developing and
troubleshooting sections of the code one at a time. A common scenario where
this is useful in data science is when you read in data from a file in one code
cell and start working and iterating on the analysis part in the next code cell
without the need to reread the data every time you want to test your new
analysis. We will talk more about code cell workflows later.

Sometimes, when you want to experiment or check something, it can make sense
to write and run Python code in the console. However, most of the time, you'll
want to write and run your code from a script.  Using
scripts has the benefit of saving your work, commonly as a text file with the
`.py` extension, while also being able to run
the code just like in the console. The script then has the added benefit of
being easy to share and runnable outside of the IDE.

We have now told the computer what to do by using Python code, and we have run that
code in two different ways within our "workbench" - the Spyder IDE. Let's
see what else we can use in this environment to help us.

## Variables, Objects, Methods {#py-getting-started-objects}

Besides running functions that *do* something (as above), we'll also want
to use Python to keep track of information that we're using throughout
our analysis. We save that information by giving it a name (called a [variable][variable]),
using the name, an equals sign (`=`) and then the information to save.
For example:

```{python}
message = "It is a far, far better thing that I do, than I have ever done"
name_length = len("Sydney Carton")
```

The actual values being referenced by the variable (to the right of
the equals sign) are stored by the
programming language as an [object][object]. There are different
types of objects based on the type of information you're using.
On the top right pane, there's a
tab that says "Variable Explorer". If you click on that, you'll see the
variables and corresponding objects you just created,
with some additional information about the *Type* - `str` (string of letters),
 `int` (integer), `float` (a "floating point" number, or decimal) and more.

Objects can also be referenced later in functions by using their variable name:

```{python}
print("My message:", message)
print("Letters in name:", name_length)
```

Most types have special functions specific to that type, called [methods][method].
Methods look like functions (`name()`), but instead
of putting the input information inside the parentheses (as we did with the
functions above), methods are tacked onto the end of a variable, assuming
that the "input" information the method uses is coming from that variable.

For example, what happens if we use the following string methods:

```{python}
message.upper()
message.split()
```

Here, it's assumed that the contents of the `message` variable are the
information used by the `upper()` and `split()` string methods. Note how
an `upper()` method makes sense for strings, but wouldn't make sense for
a numeric object.

## Getting Help in Spyder {#py-getting-started-spyder-help}

That top-right pane can give us additional information; one of
the other tabs says "Help". The main way to look up a particular function
or type is to type it into the Console and then type the Help shortcut (which
is `CTRL-I`). So, if you wanted to look up information about the `len()`
function, we used above, you can type the following into the console and
then use the help shortcut:

```{python eval=FALSE}
len
```

Typing the full name of the function (without pressing `ENTER`)
with the Help tab selected will also
trigger the help page about that function:

```{python eval=FALSE}
len()
```

You can see what methods are available for an object by typing the variable
name into the console or script pane and then pressing `TAB`. This will bring
up a list of possible methods to use.

## Getting Help Online {#py-getting-started-web-help}

Sometimes, however, your questions won't fit well within the built-in help pages,
available through Spyder. This often happens when you need to do something
completely new and you don't know where to start. In that scenario, there are
multiple internet resources that are helpful:

* blogs
* question pages on Stack Overflow
* Twitter

Sometimes these resources can be overwhelming and confusing. Some things to
look for on a Stack Overflow answer:

* Is the question clearly stated and is there example code? If you're
debugging, does the example code look like yours?
* Answers have upvotes and downvotes. Is there one clear answer that has a lot
of upvotes in response to a question?
* How complex is the answer? While some questions will necessarily have a
complicated answer, for many common programming tasks, there should be a
few-line solution to the question.
* Do you recognize any terms in the solution? If you don't, are there other
terms that you could search on?

expects as input, and what kind of output it produces?

1. What would be the pros and cons of using the console versus a script in each situation?
    - Writing a data analysis with multiple steps.
    - Opening a new data set and exploring its dimensions.
    - Checking the value of a variable.

1. You've saved a string of interesting data to a variable.

    ```{python}
    sentence = "One fish, two fish, red fish, blue fish."

    How can you count the occurrences of the letter "f"?

1. After googling "how to read csv file python", these two answers pop up:
  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41585078/how-do-i-read-and-write-csv-files-with-python/41585079
  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5788521/reading-a-csv-file-using-python
    - What is useful about each page?
    - Do you understand all of the code in the second page?
    - There are many options given in the first Stack Overflow page. Which one seems like a good place to start?
    - Both pages include python libraries (extra tools), which are added to the
    code using `import`. Based on this information, looking at the options shown
    in these two pages, what are two libraries that can be used to
    read in csv files?

1. Try reading a csv file:

    ```{python eval=FALSE}
    import pandas
