-   Functions allow partitioning of code into segments that perform specific
    tasks. They make code easier to write, read, troubleshoot, and reuse.
-   Functions can have default values for certain input parameters, which
    allows these parameters not to be explicitly set every time a function is
    called.
-   Ducktyping relies on the Python interpreter to raise meaningful errors when
    an illegal operation tries to execute.
-   Assert statements can be used to explicitly check the truth value of
    a condition and halt code execution if needed. 
-   When asking for help online, it is critical to include a minimal reproducible
    example so that the question can receive suitable replies.
-   Packages makes it easy to reuse and share code in an organized and automated
    manner. These can be installed with package managers.
