-   A version control system allows you to record the history of changes to a file
    and recover older versions when needed.
-   Each snapshot that captures information about a change is called a commit.
-   Commits are stored in a version control repository,
    usually associated with a project folder and all its nested sub-folders.
-   A version control tool like Git has commands that allow you to make commits,
    review them,
    and revert back to previous commits (if needed).
-   Make commits frequently when actively working on a project.
-   Version controlled repositories can be duplicated online or on other computers.
-   A public respository can be duplicated and used to work on any computer.
-   Large data files and private information should not be stored on a public version control repository.
